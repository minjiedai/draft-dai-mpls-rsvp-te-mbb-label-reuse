      <t>
          The concept of "make-before-break (MBB)" while rerouting MPLS
          RSVP-TE tunnels is discussed in [RFC3209].  In the procedure
          that is outlined, the behaviour of downstream label assignment
          for the new LSP (new tunnel instance) is not well defined.  As
          a general practice, a different label is assigned by each
          downstream router and advertised to the upstream router in the
          RESV message for the new LSP; this results in a separate
          end-to-end data-plane path for the new LSP (with the exception
          of PHP LSPs or UHP LSP with explicit label on the last hop).
          The consequence of this practice is that the label entry gets
          added/deleted in the LFIB at every non-ingress router along
          the LSP path during MBB.  Also, the ingress router would need
          to update all the applications using this LSP when switching
          to the new tunnel instance, as the new tunnel instance uses
          different outgoing label.  This in turn may also cause other
          elements of the network which are dependant on the LSP to do
          the update.
      </t>
      <t>
          Such network churn can be avoided or reduced if the same label
          can be re-used (kept intact) wherever it is affecting neither
          the routing functionalities nor the data path verification of
          each instance. This document proposes a set of procedures to 
          facilitate label reuse when there is a total or partial path 
          overlap between the two tunnel instances during MBB.

      <t>
          MPLS RSVP-TE make-before-break (MBB) procedure is defined in
          <xref target="RFC3209"/>.  The behaviour of downstream label
          assignment for the new LSP (new tunnel instance) is not
          well-defined in this procedure.  In most MBB implementations,
          a different label is assigned by each downstream router and
          advertised to upstream router in the RESV message for the new
          Label Switched Path (LSP).  This means a separate end-to-end
          data-plane path for the new tunnel instance (with the
          exception of PHP LSPs or UHP LSPs with explicit NULL label at
          the last hop).  Although this allows for independent
          end-to-end path verification for each tunnel instance, it
          requires an LFIB entry add/delete at every non-ingress router
          along the path of the LSP during MBB even if the paths for the
          new tunnel instance and the old tunnel instance might be
          partially or totally overlapping.  Label reuse under partial
          or total overlap condition reduces unnecessary LFIB update,
          reduces the possibility of errors and improves network
          convergence latency. In addition, whenever label is reused, the
          setup time for the new tunnel instance would be faster because
          there is no need for the transit routers along the path of the
          new LSP to wait for the new LFIB entry to be added.
      </t>
      <section title="Common LSP MBB triggers" toc="default">
            <t>
                The MBB procedure can be triggered because of a change
                to any property of the RSVP-TE tunnel. The most common
                case is a change to the bandwidth requirement,
                especially with the widely implemented auto-bandwidth
                feature, which dynamically adjusts the LSP bandwidth
                based on traffic-monitoring feedback. With CSPF commonly
                used to compute path to meet the new bandwidth
                requirements, it is possible that the existing path is
                still one of the best paths which can satisfy the new
                requirements. This provides the opportunity to reuse
                labels to achieve the benefits described. If given the
                choice and the goal of selecting the best path is not
                the highest priority, CSPF can also prefer the existing
                path to other possible paths to take full advantage of
                the label reuse as long as the requirements are still
                met by the existing path.

    <section title="Recommended conditions for label reuse"
        toc="default">
      <t>
          The notion of “Label reuse” can be applied for both
          point-to-point (P2P) LSP and point-to-multipoint (P2MP) LSP,
          but due to the complexity of P2MP and many possible variations
          of the solutions, this document will only focus on the
          recommendations for P2P LSPs.
      </t>
      <t>
          Labels can be reused when the primary paths of the two tunnel
          instances have complete overlap starting from a certain point
          in the paths and going all the way to the egress router of the
          LSP. The best case scenario is complete overlap of the two
          paths end to end; in which case there is no need for any label
          changes and LFIB updates, both in the transit as well as in the
          ingress routers. Existing data plane verification method can be
          used to verify new tunnel instance as before. Data traversing 
          on either instance will take a different label path from the 
          ingress to this transit router and from then on the traffic will
          merge into the shared label switched path towards the egress router.
      </t>
      <t>
          The conditions under which label reuse can be applied are as
          following:
          <list style="symbols">
              <t>
                  Egress router of LSP: Reuse-label functionality can
                  always be applied.
              </t>
              <t>
                  Transit routers of the LSP: For any given transit
                  router of P2P LSP, label can be reused if the
                  following conditions are met:
                  <list style="format (%c)">
                      <t>
                          Downstream label received is the same
                      </t>
                      <t>
                          NHOP is the same
                      </t>
                  </list>
              </t>
              <t>
                  Ingress router of the LSP: When the same conditions as
                  listed under transit router are met, instead of no
                  label change, there is no need for ingress route
                  update for LSP to applications depending on it.
              </t>
          </list>
      </t>
      <t>
          The label reuse procedure starts from the egress of the LSP as
          RESV traverses upstream towards the ingress of the LSP; it
          terminates at the first transit router where paths of the two
          tunnel instances diverge towards the ingress of the LSP or at
          the transit router which doesn’t support label reuse.

        <section title="Enable/Disable label-reuse capability"
            toc="default">
            <t>
                This document recommends enabling “label-reuse”
                capability by default. Allow it to be disabled if needed
                by changing configuration.
            </t>
        </section>
        <section title="Prefer overlapping path to facilitate label-reuse"
            toc="default">
            <t>
                In order to take full advantage of the label-reuse
                capability, path computation for the new tunnel instance
                may seek to maximize path overlap. This can be achieved
                through two approaches.
            </t>
            <t>
                <list style="symbols">
                    <t>
                        The first approach is to select from the best
                        paths available the path which has the most path
                        overlap with the existing path starting from the
                        egress router.
                    </t>
                    <t>
                        The second approach is to prefer the existing
                        path if it still satisfies the new requirement,
                        even though it might not be the best path.
                    </t>
                </list>
            </t>
            <t>
                The choice between the approaches is a matter of local
                computation policy and can be different for different
                types of MBB trigger.
